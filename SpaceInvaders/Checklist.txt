TO-DO
-------
1. Make function game_loop in spaceinvaders.py into a class
2. game_loop needs to have a method to pull the score & game state 
    - Game state should be one of two things:
        1) easy: returns a dictionary of the current positions of every object 
        2) difficult but less pain in the ass in the future: returns the current frame
